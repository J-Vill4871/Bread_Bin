    <h1>Strength Training Tips</h1>
    <p>Strength training involves using external resistance to challenge your muscles. Here are some tips to help you get started:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Warm Up and Cool Down:</strong> Spend 5-10 minutes warming up (walking is great) and cooling down (stretching) before and after your workout.</li>
        <li><strong>Focus on Form:</strong> Proper form is crucial. Align your body correctly and move smoothly through each exercise to avoid injuries.</li>
        <li><strong>Work at the Right Tempo:</strong> Control your movements rather than relying on momentum. This maximizes strength gains.</li>
        <li><strong>Pay Attention to Breathing:</strong> Breathe consistently during your workouts to maintain focus and energy.</li>
        <li><strong>Gradually Increase Weight or Resistance:</strong> Challenge your muscles by progressively adding weight or resistance over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Aim for strength workouts 3 times per week. You can alternate between upper and lower body exercises.</li>
        <li><strong>Teaming Up:</strong> Consider working out with a friend for motivation and accountability.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Remember to consult a fitness professional or a doctor before starting any new exercise program. Enjoy your strength training journey! üí™üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
